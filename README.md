In the assert of the unit test, I have considered to do it with CollectionAssert.AreEqual, but it compares also the references and it does not work, 
I also considered to do it with linq instead of the for loop, but the two loops are nested and the result is not correct, 
at the end I have thought to do that method, I do not know if some other more effective way to do it.
